This is an elementary geospatial visualisation exercise on Python. I use the polygon shapefile containing the first-level administrative divisions (provinces) of Netherlands. All the CBS datasets used are contained in the Data folder. The direct link to the shapefile is given in the notebook. The shapefile description, other formats and shapefiles with other administrative divisions can be found [here](https://maps.princeton.edu/catalog/stanford-st293bj4601). In the output folder, the html files as well as GIFs of the interactive plots can be found.
